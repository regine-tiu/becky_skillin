        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Becky hails from Western Pennsylvania in the United States and studied at Eastern University with majors in English and Spanish. In the last 22 years, she and her husband have lived in Honduras, Oman, Ecuador, Uruguay, Washington, D.C., and Canada and are set to move to Jordan in the fall of 2021. With children coming and going along the way, in some of those places she has taught, in others she has sung, and in all of them, she has explored the beauty and uniqueness of each location. She loves everything about books: how they look on a shelf, feel in our hands, and linger in our thoughts. Editing allows her to combine a love of peopleâ€™s individual stories while meeting the need to have those stories known. She is writing her first book.
