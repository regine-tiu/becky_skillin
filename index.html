          "Becky helped me with guidance on different levels . . . from shaping it at the beginning and editing but also ISBN numbers and copyright pages.  It is a thorough process, so you know in the end your book will be done with excellence and you are satisfied with the finished product. Becky was a godsend to me as I self-published for the first time. Not only did she care about my book, she cared about me as a person."
